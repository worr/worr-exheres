SUMMARY="create and use a local lib/ for perl modules with PERL5LIB"
DESCRIPTION="
The version of a Perl package on your machine is not always the version
you need. Obviously, the best thing to do would be to update to the
version you need. However, you might be in a situation where you're
prevented from doing this.
local::lib solves this problem by allowing you to create your own
directory of Perl packages downloaded from CPAN (in a multi-user system,
this would typically be within your own home directory).
