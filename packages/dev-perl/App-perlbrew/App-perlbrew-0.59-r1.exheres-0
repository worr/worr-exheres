SUMMARY="Manage perl installations in your \$HOME"
DESCRIPTION="
perlbrew is a program to automate the building and installation of perl
in an easy way. It installs everything to ~/perl5/perlbrew, and requires
you to tweak your PATH by including a bashrc/cshrc file it provides. You
then can benefit from not having to run 'sudo' commands to install cpan
modules because those are installed inside your HOME too. It provides
multiple isolated perl environments, and a mechanism for you to switch
between them.
