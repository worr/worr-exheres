SUMMARY="Add test failures if warnings are caught"
DESCRIPTION="
This module hooks $SIG{__WARN__} and converts warnings to Test::More
'fail()' calls. It is designed to be used with 'done_testing',
when you don't need to know the test count in advance. Just as with
Test::NoWarnings, this does not catch warnings if other things localize
$SIG{__WARN__}, as this is designed to catch *unhandled* warnings.
